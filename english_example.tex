\section{Last Will and Testament}
All of my money and possessions are to be transferred to the United States Federal Government. All of my assets are to be liquidated and deposited into the US Treasury. 

\section{Advance Directive}
Do not resuscitate (DNR). Do NOT leave me in a coma on life support if the doctors collectively believe I will not awaken. Pull the plug immediately.
